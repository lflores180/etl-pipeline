# ETL pipeline

## Introduction
This repository contains code from an ETL pipeline project I did in my bootcamp

- Extracts transactional data form a local database
- Identifies and removes duplicates
- Loads the transformed data to a s3 bucket

## Requirements
- The minimum requirement is Python3 
- Import the necessary libraries 

## Step by step:
- Create the folders and files we need (the most organized possible)
- Create the .env file for storage the keys and keep them safe. 
- Fetch the environment variables from the .env file using the getenv function
- Create the src file and write the code for the functions we need.
- Write the code on our main.py file
